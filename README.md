# woptimize

**woptimize** is a Windows optimization utility written entirely in Batch (`.bat`).
It provides a structured, menu-driven interface for applying system, CPU, memory,
network, and service optimizations — without executing anything accidentally.

Nothing runs automatically on launch. All actions require explicit user selection
through sub-menus.

## ⚠️ Important Notice

This tool makes **low-level system changes** (registry edits, service configuration,
power settings, boot configuration, etc.).

- **Administrator privileges are required**
- Use at your own risk
- Recommended for **advanced users** who understand Windows internals
- Always create a **restore point** before applying optimizations
